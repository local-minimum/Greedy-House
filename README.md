# Greedy-House
An attempt at learing LÃ–VE2D by making a game about a house that loves things a little too much.

## Story Bits and Ideas

* Humans would probably find walking houses offensive, so you should probably avoid being seen strolling about. And definitely don't accidentally squish anyone.
* The greedy house can walk around freely as long as they don't stray away from the proximity of roads. Whatever would become of greedy house if it left civilization behind? Lets not thing such thoughts for now.
* Of course there has to be days if there are nights. But as everyone knows, houses stay put during the day. So you better find a sweet spot to settle in and... what? What do houses really do during the day? What happens if you don't obey and move around during the day?
